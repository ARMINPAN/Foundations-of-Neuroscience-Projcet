Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a way to measure electrical activity of
the brain but the poor spatial resolution limits us to record activity of asingle
neuron. Local Field Potential (LFP) is a technique that by using
electrode arrays can record in depth. Using LFPs we can decode each
neuronâ€˜s behaviour and see what is it that each neuron is responsive
to. Here we demonstrated that LFPs recorded from Primary Motor
and Dorsal-Ventral Pre-Motor Cortices will have a significant low
frequency component on the onset of a hand movement of a monkey
and an averaged increased firing rate at this onset. We also show
that some neurons are responsible for encoding different types of
kinematics.
